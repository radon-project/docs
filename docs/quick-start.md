# Quick start

To get started with Radon language you can use the built-in REPL or just run
the Radon file. Run a Radon file by typing `radon -s <filename>.rn` in the
command line. For example, if you have a file named `hello.rn` you can run it
by typing `radon -s hello.rn` in the command line.

## REPL

The REPL is a command line interface that allows you to run Radon code
interactively. To start the REPL, just type `radon` in the command line.
You can then type Radon code and it will be executed immediately. To exit the
REPL, just type `exit()` or press `Ctrl + Z`.

## Hello World

The first program that most people write in a new language is the "Hello World"
program. This program simply prints the words "Hello World" to the screen. Here
is the "Hello World" program in Radon:

```py linenums="1" title="HelloWorld.rn"
print("Hello World")
```
