# Data types

## Basic types

The basic types are:

- `int` - integer number.
- `float` - floating point number.
- `bool` - boolean value.
- `string` - string of characters.

## Arrays

Arrays are declared using the `[]` syntax. The type of the array is the type
of the elements it contains.

```rn linenums="1" title="arrays.rn"
a = [1, 2, 3] # a is an array of ints
b = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0] # b is an array of floats
c = ["a", "b", "c"] # c is an array of strings

# Arrays can be nested
d = [[1, 2], [3, 4]] # d is an array of arrays of ints

# Arrays can be empty
e = [] # e is an empty array of unknown type
```

## Hashmaps

Hashmaps (or objects) are declared using the `{}` syntax.
The type of the object is the type of the fields it contains.

```rn linenums="1" title="objects.rn"
# a is an object with fields x and y of type int
a = { x: 1, y: 2 };
# b is an object with fields x and y of type float
b = { x: 1.0, y: 2.0 };
# c is an object with fields x and y of type string
c = { x: "a", y: "b" };

# Objects can be nested
# d is an object with fields x and w of type object
d = { x: { y: 1, z: 2 }, w: { y: 3, z: 4 } };

# Objects can be empty
# e is an empty object of unknown type
e = {};
```
