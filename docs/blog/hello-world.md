## Introduction

We are excited to announce the launch **Radon** - a new open source programming language for the modern world. The language is designed to be simple, fast, and safe while incorporating modern language features such as type inference, pattern matching, and more. A key goal of the language is to be easy to learn and use, while still being powerful enough to build complex applications. It is also designed to be easy to embed in other applications, and to be used as a scripting language. The language is currently in the early stages of development, and we are looking for contributors to help us build the language.
